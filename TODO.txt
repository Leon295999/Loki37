TODO

config.json
	have the sorting column be a config value, and have the internal check
	be against that rather than the timestamp by default

follow_the_money.py
  have it possible to output an acct_types list, when relevant
	  and to then avoid a txn_types list, when irrelevant
	implement a --longest cutoff to avoid recursion errors

follow.py
if recursion is slow for time checking, have the Branch class remember
	the time of it's root transaction when it is created
