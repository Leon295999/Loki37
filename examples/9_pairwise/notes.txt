Pairwise

-- pairwise

This option outputs *partial* flows into and out of every account along 
the way of the flows generated using the standard algorithm. This is meant
to make it simple to extract all the relevant durations. 

`account_txns.csv`

  This example takes the perspective of a single account, so you'll see 
  that there is actually no difference between the output with and without
  the --pairwise option. Neither for --lifo nor for --mixed.

`network_txns.csv`

  This example involves a network of accounts, so the --pairwise option
  results in very different output. It is as if we are taking each account
  separately, so we end up recording twice each transaction that would 
  just be extending flows under the base functionality. The durations,
  however, as they correspond to pairs, are recorded only once.
  
  Specifically for the case where boundaries are defined by transactions, 
  as in this example, the double-recorded transactions are those of a type 
  mapped to "transfer" in the configuration file. Nothing changes for the 
  transactions of types mapped to "deposit" or "withdraw".  

  It should be noted that size limits, time windows, known balances, 
  provider fees, system boundaries, inconsistencies, and time cutoffs 
  all operate in the same way as without --pairwise. Invoking this 
  option is *not* the same as making other drastic adjustments.
